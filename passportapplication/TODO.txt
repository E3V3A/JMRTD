TODO (for all JMRTD projects, not just passportapplication), towards 0.4.4

General
+ Revert back to one jmrtd.jar (includes all of SCUBA)
+ Move LDS data classes (*File, *Info) into org.jmrtd.lds package.
+ Move BACStore to passporthostapi (from passportapplication).
+ Fix unit test (when run from package explorer hangs on DG14 tests).
- Make loading of GRT compatible ZIP files possible. They seem to use EF_DG<X>.BIN naming inside ZIP files. Test it.
- Move some of the PKCS7 (or 9?) signature checking stuff from SODFile to SCUBA (it's not MRTD specific).
- Uniform handling of BAC, CSCA, CVCA stores. Use Java keystores instead of flat files?
- Padding error during AA on Omnikey 5121 on newer versions of NIK. Restore gracefully from session?
- Copy default files from distribution jar into .jmrtd/
- Adoption of Henning's stuff in SCUBA (finger printing passports based on nationality) is buggy for now. Need more regression testing.

Dependencies
+ Latest JAI ImageIO 1.2
+ Latest Bouncy Castle 1.45
- cert-cvc latest is 1.2.11. Need EAC samples to test. Woj still has samples?
- Update README (also jmrtd.org?)

Preferences
+ Tabbed panes in preferences.
+ APDU tracing from preferences, at least for card manager (also for reload action?).
- CV cert & key folder settings from tab in preferences window.
- CSCA folder setting from tab in preferences window. (And copy default CSCA files from jar into $HOME/.jmrtd).
- Preferences saving to $HOME/.jmrtd/jmrtd.properties.
- Remember location of directory from which (passport) files were loaded, return there when opening new file.

ASN.1 parsing:
- Test TLV input streams based on chaosinmotion stuff. Write tests. If ok, use those instead.
- ASN.1 DGs based on JavaAsn1Compiler stuff (maybe just for testing, maybe generate bits of the actual DG*File and *Info classes.

Code quality
- Profiling (http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/documents/tutorials/profilingtool/profilingexample_32.html)
- Run Findbugs. Add it to eclipse.

Web site (jmrtd.org)
+ Check new docs on ICAO site, update links.
+ Fix scmmicro.com broken links in install.shtml.
+ Add a link to http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/EPassport#Manufacturers (which manufacturer makes ePassport for which country?) on csca.shtml.
- A faq would be nice, with a howto compile it yourself.

SCUBA support for exotic card readers
- Use Roel's libnfc with JNI wrapper for support of other readers (Arygon, etc.).
- JCOP tools supported terminals such as Pegoda (need to purchase one for this?).
- Nokia NFC relay terminal via Bluetooth.

Way too ambitious
- Displaying of WSQ finger print images, either by JNI wrapping the NIST C files (see sourceforge) or implementing it in pure Java.
- Webcam OCR of MRZ (OCR-B font).
