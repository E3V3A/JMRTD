JMRTD

   JMRTD is a free implementation of the Machine Readable Travel Document
   (MRTD) standards as specified by the International Civil Aviation
   Organization (ICAO). Both a card side application (the "passport applet")
   and a host side API for accessing ICAO standards compliant MRTDs are
   developed. The passport applet is written in Java Card. The host side API
   is written in Java.
