--------------------------

+ Second release of the passport reader.


VERSION 0.3 (2008-08-05)
------------------------

VERSION 0.4.7 (2012-03-27)
--------------------------

General
+ Abstraction of SCUBA smartcard layer.
+ Implementation of SCUBA smartcard layer for j2se and Android 2.3.
+ Reported by Wim M.: The order of crypto providers matters? Test with SUN first, BC last. Appears to be fixed.
+ CardManager hot pluggable card terminal events (Pim Vullers contributed patches). Stable in GUI (preferences)?
+ Latest Bouncy Castle 1.47.
+ Cleanup SCUBA so that we have a smaller number of project.
+ Consistent naming and param order in PassportService and Passport (readFile vs getInputStream).
+ Document number > 9 digits. MRZ document number field "spill over" to optional information field.

LDS
+ Moved progressive mode stuff out of FaceInfo.
+ Moved java.awt.* dependencies out of org.jmrtd.lds package.
+ Cleaned up CBEFF groups data groups and related types. Create seperate package org.jmrtd.cbeff.

+ Finger and iris bio template I/O are at the same level as face bio template.
+ Implemented getEncoded() for all classes in org.jmrtd.lds package, especially DG3, DG4, FingerPrintInfo, IrisInfo. Uniformly use readObject() and writeObject().
+ Restructured LDS base classes. Introduced *ImageInfo and LDSInfo.
+ Started renaming classes, prefer "Document" and "MRTD" over "Passport".
+ In FaceInfo, angles (yaw, pitch etc.) value 0 should be treated as UNDEFINED; don't try to convert to degrees (for now), just use coded values.

GUI
+ First attempt at tree view in editor mode. (Content panel not tree event driven yet, though.)
+ User should be able to select either ID-1 or ID-3 / document code "I<" etc. (3 or 2 line MRZ) in edit mode. Update tree view.
+ Show DG3 and DG4 in tree if present, even if not readable.
+ MacOS X: Top menu, About dialog, AppData dir (in FileUtil).

Android
+ Proof of concept app on Nexus S (DG1, DG2, with BAC, basic GUI, by Max Guenther).

ImageIO
+ Added a JJ2000 (pure Java JPEG2000) based ImageIO provider (read only), as an alternative to JAI ImageIO.
+ WSQ native libs for i386/x86_64 MacOS X, Windows, Linux.

Code quality

+ Cleanup and rename in LDS. Added a top level LDS class.
+ Reorganize file system code to eliminate sending unnecessary duplicate APDUs and add caching of READ BINARY responses.

GUI
+ Work around for bug showing multiple card terminals entries in terminals list in preferences after hot plugging card terminals.

Android
+ Easier build of jmrtd.jar for developers, no more manual rewriting to work around Bouncy Castle thanks to jarjar.

ImageIO
+ Fixed problem with JJ2000 decoding (artifacts). Was related to conversion unsigned to signed.
+ Use pure Java WSQ based on JNBIS. (credits to Mohammad Shamsi)
+ Metadata for WSQ imageio and WSQ v3.1 support. (credits to Paulo Costa)
+ Also have an image writer based on JJ2000, custom interface and imageio interface.

0.4.9 (FUTURE)
--------------

General
+ Remove threading from JMRTD host API.
+ DG11 and DG12 encoding of dates (see R7-p1_v2_sIII_0058).
+ DG11 and DG12 encoding of A0 complex structures (for 5F0F resp. 5F1A).
+ Clean up ImageInfo inputstream to allow progressive rendering in principle (via org.jmtrd.io classes).
+ Move BACStore back to passportapplication (from passporthostapi).
+ Passport file list is based on EF.COM, should be EF.SOd hash list (see Passport around line 282).
+ Pre-calculated BAC keys (Mikheil Kapananza has use case for this; Bug 19 on SF bug tracker)
+ Finer grained verification status, i.e. move verifyHashes out of verifyDS.
- Refactor protocol status out of VerificationStatus.
- More information in verification status (computed hashes, derived certificate chain) to make relying UI as easy as possible.
- Offer support for reporting invalid certificate (expired, revoked) in VerificationStatus.

EAC
- ChipAuthentication (in doCA) with explicit keyId seems to use wrong encoding. Check that it is ok now.
+ Clean up terminal authentication, make sig algorithm detection according to spec.
- CVCA keystore usage. BKS is only candidate given requirements (EC crypto + CVcerts)
- Check that we use privkey corresponding to EF.CVCA / EF.DG14.
- CVCA re-order the list of cvcerts so that it is a chain.

GUI
- MRZ doc number, we add '<', consequences for GUI?

ImageIO
+ Grayscale JPEG2000 signed/unsigned decoding issue. Reported by Aine Ni Fhloinn of inhousetraining.ie.

Android
- New app, improved UI, in Google Play (Novay with support of EIT ICT Labs).
- Investigate problem with EAC enabled Dutch MRTDs and Nexus 4 (NL applet throws security status SWs on "progressive" reading, but lineair reading without switching DGs is ok).

SCUBA
+ Cater for extended length APDU checking (either getATR, or isExtendedLengthSupported method)

Dependencies
+ Latest Bouncy Castle 1.48 for J2SE. (We're back to 1.47 for now, because of Spongy.)
- Latest Spongy Castle (1.48?) for Android.

Code quality
- Check unit tests.
- Check JavaDoc.
- Check Findbugs.


0.5.x (FUTURE)
--------------

General
- Check new version of 9303 (expected second half 2013) and LDS 1.8 (in TR)
- Implement SAC/PACE. Check status of OpenPACE project on SF.
- Support SPOC web service for EAC/CVCA (test with e.g. http://sandbox.safelayer.com/en/epassport-test, http://www.openscdp.org/scripts/icao/eacpki.html)
- CRL validity checking via PKD cert store (seems buggy now, at least with BC PKIX algorithm implementation)
- Check and compare date (current system time) and warn if certificate has expired
- Adoption of Henning's stuff in SCUBA (finger printing Nationality of passports based on error messages) is buggy for now. Need more regression testing.
- Check dependencies on BC in public interfaces. Especially in Woj's EAC stuff.
- Move (some of) the PKCS7 signature checking stuff from SODFile to SCUBA (it's not MRTD specific).
- Find some way to bring the progressive reading of JPEG, JPEG2000 back.
- Move BAC (and maybe also AA, EAC) out of VerificationStatus and into CapabilityStatus (or PresenceStatus, or whatever).
- Version for Embedded Java on Raspberry Pi and similar.
- Version for Blackberry OS.

MRZ
- MRZ truncation. Provide interfaces for custom rules. Implement reasonable default rules.
- MRZ character transliteration. Provide interface for custom rules. Implement reasonable default rules.
- MRZ optional field rules (e.g., personal  number for Dutch case). Provide interface for custom rules. Implement reasonable default rules.
- Check "V<", ID-2 MRZInfo.

GUI
- Bug in loading document from file without SOd (is silently accepted, perhaps we should generate SOd?).
- Improve certificate / trust store viewing and editing (both CSCA, CVCA)
- In general: better interaction, based on user purpose/task (inspection / security testing / personalization / identity provisioning).
- Alternative editor view (file tree style) on passport, showing all files available with option to save individual files as binary dumps.
  Perhaps even present ASN.1 tree in a JTree.
- Edit mode for German "D<<" documents shows wrong nationality and issuing country in combo box (is correct in display mode though).
- Updating tree view in edit mode based on LDS model in passporthostapi, instead of TreeModel in passportapplication.
- Ability to add (and delete) complete DGs from tree view in edit mode from binary files.
- Cleanup dynamic EAC menu in DocumentViewFrame and DocumentEditFrame.
- Allow creation of documents with EAC from edit mode.
- Wire shark style viewing of files in content pane in tree view.
- Show IrisInfo in edit mode?!?

Android
- Full GUI, all DGs, security validation.
- Camera based OCR of MRZ. How difficult could this be, really? It's always OCR-B font, one could assume fixed
  distance so that auto-focus isn't even necessary. See also https://sourceforge.net/projects/javaocr/.
- Demo app showing verification based on CSCA.
- Robustness, consistency.

EAC
- Improve unit tests for EAC and CVCA.

Java Card
- Modularize applet so that it is easier to create BAC only MRTD (for cards that don't support the crypto).

Bugs/temporary fixes
- Fix padding error during AA on Omnikey 5121 on newer versions of NL NIK. Restore gracefully from session?
- Omnikey 5121 buggy (fails BAC) when read for second time after polling start

ASN.1 parsing
- Remove dependencies on BC for ASN.1 / TLV, at least from public interface.
- Test TLV input streams based on chaosinmotion or bnotes stuff. Write tests. If ok, use those instead.
- ASN.1 DGs based on JavaAsn1Compiler stuff (maybe just for testing, maybe generate bits of the actual DG*File and *Info classes).

SCUBA
- Cleanup. Declare all non-smart card stuff out of scope. Single jar.
- Use Roel's libnfc with JNI wrapper for support of other readers (Arygon, etc.).
- JCOP tools supported terminals such as Pegoda (see also http://alud.sourceforge.net/, can we JNI wrap this?).
- Fix "Card has been disconnected" error in acrprovider? Restore gracefully.
